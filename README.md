# Engineered_Models

This repository contains wide untrained convolutional neural networks that can compete with standard pre-trained CNNs at predicting neural responses in primate visual cortex. To use the expansion model, clone the repository to a local directrory and proceed as you would with any pytorch model. The call_model notebook shows how the model can be initialized.
